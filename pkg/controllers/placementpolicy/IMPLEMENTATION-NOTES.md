# Implementation notes: FEP-0001 placement policy controller (#786)

Observations collected while implementing the controller against the
`placement.kubefleet.dev/v1alpha1` APIs. Items in "API gaps" are candidate
follow-ups for the API definition (#781/#803); they are recorded here rather
than silently worked around, and the ones marked *pinned* have a test in this
package demonstrating the current behavior.

## API gaps found while implementing

1. **`ClusterSelector.count` accepts non-positive integers** (*pinned*). The
   field is `XIntOrString` with `Pattern="^([1-9][0-9]{0,2}|All)$"`, but a
   pattern only constrains the string form; integer values bypass it entirely,
   so `count: 0` and `count: -1` pass CRD validation. The controller rejects
   them at evaluation time (`resolveCounts`), surfacing
   `Scheduled=False/InvalidClusterSelectors`. Suggested API fix: a CEL rule
   such as `type(self.count) == int ? self.count >= 1 : true`.

2. **Numeric operators are accepted in `matchLabelExpressions` at admission**
   (*pinned*). `MatchLabelExpressions` reuses the
   `LabelClusterPropertyExpression` type, whose enum includes `Gt`/`Lt`/etc.;
   the API doc comment defers misuse to "an error at the scheduling phase".
   Admission could reject it instead:
   `self.all(e, e.operator in ['In', 'NotIn', 'Exists', 'DoesNotExist'])` on
   the `matchLabelExpressions` field. Until then, the controller surfaces
   `Scheduled=False/InvalidClusterSelectors`.

3. **Aggregation across multiple selectors follows the FEP's overlapping-selectors
   note.** A cluster satisfying two selectors of the same policy counts toward
   both in `desiredClusters`/`scheduledClusters` (per-selector sums) — the
   FEP's "About overlapping cluster selectors" section explicitly allows
   totals to deviate from the sum of counts when selectors overlap. For a
   `count: All` selector the desired count floors at `minCount`, so an
   unfulfilled All selector shows a gap instead of trivially reporting
   `desired == scheduled`.

4. **`Scheduled` condition semantics with `minCount`.** The API's reason
   constants encode a binary contract (`FoundAllRequiredClusters` /
   `FailedToFindSomeRequiredClusters`), so reaching the floor (minCount) but
   not the desired count reports `False` here, with the floor state surfaced
   in the condition message. Whether the floor deserves a dedicated reason
   (or a `True` polarity) is an FEP-level question worth settling before
   beta; the claim lifecycle also needs a defined stance on whether a
   floor-satisfied selector still warrants a claim.

5. **Status count fields lack `+kubebuilder:validation:Optional` markers**
   (`DesiredClusters` through `ActiveClusterClaims`) — cosmetic, but the
   package convention annotates every optional field.

## Deliberate implementation decisions (for reviewers)

- **Fulfillment is judged against the scheduler's eligibility gate**
  (`clustereligibilitychecker`) plus taint/toleration filtering, not raw label
  matching — a provisioner-created or newly registered cluster does not count
  until its member agent is online, heartbeating, and joined. See the
  discussion on #791.
- **Selected-cluster choice is first-N over sorted names** — a deterministic
  placeholder until the scheduling framework support lands; the counts are
  what matter to the status surface today.
- **Heartbeat-noise suppression**: member cluster watch events pass through a
  projection predicate that ignores heartbeat/observation timestamps;
  time-driven eligibility transitions (e.g., heartbeats going stale) are
  covered by periodic requeues instead (fulfilled policies re-check at half
  the eligibility timeout, bounding worst-case staleness detection at about
  1.5x the timeout).
- **Malformed per-cluster data never fails a policy**: selector specs are
  validated structurally up front, so any evaluation-time error is by
  construction caused by data one cluster self-reported (e.g., a property
  value that is not a quantity); that cluster is skipped and logged rather
  than aborting evaluation for the whole policy.
- **Claims are issued while a selector is below its desired count** (not just
  below the minCount floor), consistent with the binary Scheduled contract;
  whether floor-satisfied selectors should stop claiming is part of the same
  FEP follow-up as item 4 above.
- **Claim names are deterministic and namespace-qualified**: the name embeds
  the selector index and a hash of the policy's namespaced name, so
  same-named policies in different namespaces cannot collide on the
  cluster-scoped claim namespace, and a restarted reconciler converges on
  get-or-create instead of duplicating claims.
- **A Terminating claim occupies its budget slot**: a claim held by a
  provisioner finalizer is not replaced, so a slow teardown can starve the
  policy of its single claim slot but can never cause double-provisioning —
  the safer failure mode for a provisioner acting on the claim.
- **Cleanup is finalizer-driven**: cross-scope owner references (namespaced
  policy owning a cluster-scoped claim) are invalid in garbage collection —
  and, trap-like, accepted at admission — so claims carry ownership labels,
  the policy carries a cleanup finalizer (added before the first claim is
  created, so a crash between the two writes cannot orphan a claim), and
  deletion withdraws claims before the policy goes away. Claims are deleted
  one by one rather than via DeleteAllOf, which keeps the RBAC surface free
  of deletecollection.
- **Withdrawal is eligibility-gated**: a claim is withdrawn only when its
  selector is fulfilled by schedulable clusters, so a provisioned cluster
  that has registered but not yet joined does not withdraw the claim (the
  join-window race raised on the verification issue).
- **Selector-term changes replace the claim under the same name**: the stale
  claim is withdrawn and the same deterministic name is re-created with the
  new terms. While the old claim is held Terminating by a provisioner
  finalizer, `activeClusterClaims` keeps counting it: the withdraw round
  treats the just-deleted claim as still occupying its slot, and the
  replacement create waits for the slot to free rather than standing beside
  it, so the budget holds through the swap.
- **A policy with no cluster selectors claims like any other**: the
  synthesized "all clusters" selector inherits the API's `AddClusterClaim`
  default, so a bare policy facing an empty fleet still signals that a
  cluster is needed rather than silently waiting forever.
- **The FEP's eligible-keys allowlist is not implemented yet** (same status
  as the per-fleet concurrency limit): the only opt-out today is the
  per-selector `whenUnfulfilled: KeepSearching`. Both belong to the config
  surface the FEP describes in prose only.

## How a claim records the policy that owns it

`spec.placementPolicyRef` is the authoritative identity: it is required,
immutable, and has no length limit, so the claim watch maps an event back to
its policy through that field. The ownership **labels** exist only so that a
policy's claims can be selected server-side with a `List`, which no spec field
allows.

That distinction matters because label values stop at 63 bytes while object
names run to 253. When a policy's name does not fit, the label carries a
prefix plus a hash of the full name instead — so selecting on the label with
the policy's own name matches nothing, and consumers that must handle such
names should list claims and match on `spec.placementPolicyRef`. Generated
names are trimmed of trailing separators at every truncation point: a `.` or
`-` landing exactly on the boundary would otherwise produce a name the API
server rejects. Both flaws were found by manual testing with a 250-character
policy name, and each made claim creation fail validation and the reconciler
retry forever, with the policy silently never getting a claim.

## Operational notes

- **Disabling the feature flag with claims outstanding leaves policies
  undeletable.** The cleanup finalizer is only removed by this controller, so
  turning `--enable-placement-policy-apis` off while a policy holds cluster
  claims parks that policy in `Terminating` and leaves its claims in place
  until the flag is turned back on, at which point reconciliation resumes and
  completes the cleanup. This mirrors the existing behavior of the staged
  update run APIs and their finalizer; it is documented on the flag and in the
  chart README rather than worked around, since removing a finalizer without a
  controller to withdraw the claims would orphan them instead.
- **Restarting the hub agent mid-flow is safe**: claim creation is
  get-or-create on a deterministic name, and the finalizer is added before the
  first claim exists, so no window can orphan a claim.

## Boy Scout fixes riding along

- `pkg/scheduler/framework/plugins/clusteraffinity/types.go`: resource
  property names containing dashes in the resource name (e.g.
  `allocatable-ephemeral-storage`) were rejected by the two-segment split;
  now parsed with `strings.Cut` and covered by a regression test.

## Cleanup lists every claim

Releasing the claim-cleanup finalizer is gated on an uncached list of ALL
cluster claims, filtered by each claim's immutable `spec.placementPolicyRef`
-- the ownership labels are mutable, and a label-stripped claim vanishing
from a label-selected list would be orphaned permanently. This trades a
full-collection read per deleting policy for that guarantee; cheap while the
per-policy claim budget is 1, worth revisiting together with the
configurable concurrency limits.
