# Add Member Cluster Condition Messages

## Requirements
- Fix the bug where member cluster conditions are missing the required `Message` field
- Add human-readable messages to all member cluster condition types
- Ensure the fix is minimal and doesn't break existing functionality
- Update tests if needed to validate the new Message field

## Additional comments from user
The issue is titled "[BUG] Add the message of member cluster condition" but has no description. Based on code analysis, this refers to the missing `Message` field in `metav1.Condition` objects.

## Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Setup
- [x] Task 1.1: Analyze the codebase to understand the issue
- [x] Task 1.2: Identify the four condition-setting functions that need to be updated:
  - `markMemberClusterReadyToJoin()`
  - `markMemberClusterJoined()`
  - `markMemberClusterLeft()`  
  - `markMemberClusterUnknown()`
- [x] Task 1.3: Run existing tests to ensure baseline functionality
- [ ] Task 1.4: Look at existing message patterns in tests and other code

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Task 2.1: Add Message field to `markMemberClusterReadyToJoin()` function
- [ ] Task 2.2: Add Message field to `markMemberClusterJoined()` function  
- [ ] Task 2.3: Add Message field to `markMemberClusterLeft()` function
- [ ] Task 2.4: Add Message field to `markMemberClusterUnknown()` function
- [ ] Task 2.5: For the `notReadyCondition` in `markMemberClusterLeft()` function

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Task 3.1: Run tests to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Task 3.2: Create focused test to validate Message fields are set correctly
- [ ] Task 3.3: Update existing tests if they need to expect Message field
- [ ] Task 3.4: Build the code to ensure no compilation errors

### Success Criteria
- All four condition-setting functions include appropriate Message fields
- All tests pass
- Code builds successfully  
- Message content is human-readable and descriptive
- Changes are minimal and surgical

## Decisions
- Use descriptive, human-readable messages that match the tone of existing event messages
- Follow the existing pattern where Message field provides details about the condition transition
- Keep messages concise but informative
- Use present tense to describe the current state
