# naming convention
All APIs whose name starts with Cluster are clusterScoped resources while its counterpart whose name matches the remainder of the API represents a namespace scoped resource. 
For example, we have ClusterResourcePlacement API and ResourcePlacement API. The former is cluster scoped while the latter is namespace scoped. 
# The difference between cluster scoped and namespace scoped resources
The main difference between cluster scoped and namespace scoped resources is that cluster scoped resources are not bound to a specific namespace and can be accessed across the entire cluster, while namespace scoped resources are bound to a specific namespace and can only be accessed within that namespace. This translates to the following differences in how to get, list, create, update, and delete these resources:
## Cluster Scoped Resources
When one does CRUD on a cluster scoped resources, it only needs to know its name and type, i.e. something like this	client.Get(ctx, types.NamespacedName{Name: string(name)}, crp)
## Namespace Scoped Resources
When one does CRUD on a namespace scoped resources, it needs to know its name, type, and namespace, i.e. something like this	client.Get(ctx, types.NamespacedName{Name: string(name), Namespace: namespace}, rp)
