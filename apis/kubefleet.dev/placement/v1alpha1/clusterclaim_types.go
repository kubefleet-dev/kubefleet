	// Object names may be longer than the 63-byte limit on label values: when a policy's name
	// does not fit, the label carries a shortened, collision-resistant form of it instead, and
	// selecting on the label with the policy's own name then matches nothing. The authoritative
	// identity is always spec.placementPolicyRef, so a consumer that must handle policies with
	// names longer than 63 bytes should list cluster claims and match on that field rather than
	// select on this label.
